    <h3>Introduction</h3>
   
    <p>'C' was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
        It is a robust language.
        It is a low programming level language close to machine language
        It is widely used in the software development field.
        It is a procedure and structure oriented language.
        It has the full support of various operating systems and hardware platforms.
        Many compilers are available for executing programs written in 'C'.
        A compiler compiles the source file and generates an object file.
        A linker links all the object files together and creates one executable file.
        It is highly portable.

        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.</p>

    <h3>My expectations from this Course</h3>
    <p> learning 'C' as the main language will help me learn other programming languages, as it shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more. It is a simple language and provides faster execution.</p>
