    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Business communication is used to promote a product, service, or organization; relay information within a business; or deal with legal and similar issues. It encompasses a variety of topics including: consumer behavior, advertising, public relations, corporate communication, research and measurement, reputation management, and event management. Business communication may also refer to internal communication: a communications director will typically manage internal communication and craft messages sent to employees. It is vital that internal communications are managed properly because a poorly crafted message could foster distrust or hostility among employees.</p>
